The LT Master is a baler-wrapper combination wich can be process a great kind of material, not only mais chaff or grass; in the perspective of the game FS17, this machine can work on fields or in farm, and can process a wide variety of material greatly faster than a conventional baler and wrapper:

 - Chaff and grass can be pressed and wrapped for silage fermentation
 - Hay and straw can be pressed, and optional wrapped for weather protection
 - Woodchips can be pressed and wrapped for weather protection and for a better storage and handling, since LT Master can reduce the volume of tipical air dried woodchips.
 - Manure can also be pressed and wrapped for convenient storage and later use as fertilizer.
 - All wrapped bales have a greater value on the sell.

The mod use scripts, so will not be available for console, however all scripts are made with care and performance in mind and are multiplayer ready.
